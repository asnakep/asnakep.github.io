Dear HODLA Team,

I'm Manuel from stakepool SNAKE - snakepool.link. I'm reaching out to you because members of the "Cardano Stakepool Best Practices" Telegram Group - t.me/CardanoStakePoolWorkgroup 
have noticed excessive delays in the propagation time of your blocks on both HODLA and HODLâ‚³. 
These delays are causing several height battles and resulting in lost blocks for other stakepools. Additionally, you have several orphaned blocks due to height battles (as observed in epoch 470).

It would be greatly appreciated if you could review your configuration. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us on the Best Practices channel if needed.

Have a great day,
Manuel
